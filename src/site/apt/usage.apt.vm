Usage

  Place your <<<picture.tex>>> LaTeX file into
  <<<src/main/latex>>> and then:

+--
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
        <artifactId>jcabi-latex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <sources>
                <file>picture.tex</file>
              </sources>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>

  <<<target/site/latex/picture.png>>>.
